## Motivation

I hated when I wanted to calculate the minimum score I needed on a final to pass but:
- **Some assignments are missing** or ungraded.
- **Exam grade holders are missing**.
- **Grade weights aren't applied** correctly or are not visible.
- **Bonus points** are given and not reflected in the final grade.

## Tech Used
- **React**
- **Chakra UI**
